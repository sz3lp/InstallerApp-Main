# SentientZone Customer Portal

This module contains a lightweight React app for SentientZone customers to self-manage their quotes, jobs, and invoices. It mirrors the Installer App stack (Vite + React + Tailwind) but focuses on the customer experience.

## Features
- Magic Link authentication via Supabase
- Dashboard displaying quotes, jobs, and invoices for the loggedâ€‘in customer
- Placeholder hooks for approving quotes and paying invoices (Stripe integration)

This folder currently only contains a skeletal dashboard component and Supabase client. Further pages, routing, and UI components will be added in future tasks.
